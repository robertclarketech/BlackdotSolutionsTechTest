# Blackdot Solutions Technical Test

This test consists of two projects. The front-end project (found in the `/client` directory) and the server-side project (found in the `/api` directory). Both solutions contain their own `README.md` that explain how to build and run them individually, as well as descriptions as to certain architecture choices, so please refer to those for building instructions. It's recommended to run the server project before running the client project.

As a quick checklist before running either of them, please ensure you have installed:

- .NET Core 3.1
- Node, NPM and/or Yarn

As these will be needed to run them both.
